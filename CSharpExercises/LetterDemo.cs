/*
Create an application class named LetterDemo 
that instantiates objects of two classes named Letter and CertifiedLetter and that demonstrates all their methods.

The classes are used by a company to keep track of letters they mail to clients. 
The Letter class includes auto-implemented properties for the Name of the recipient and the Date mailed (stored as strings).

Create a child class named CertifiedLetter that includes an auto-implemented property 
TrackingNumber (of type string) that holds a tracking number for the letter.

Next, include a ToString() method that overrides the Object classâ€™s ToString() method and returns a string that contains the name of the class (using GetType()) and 
the respective class's data field values. Use default, empty constructor for both classes.
